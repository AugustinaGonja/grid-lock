# Gridlock
### The Visual Recall Game 

Gridlock is a visual memory recall game designed to be engaging for both children and adults. Inspired by brain training exercises, the game aims to enhance players' short- and long-term memory over time. The concept is derived from a game show challenge in which participants were shown a grid with a flashing pattern of connected tiles that formed a path. After a brief moment to memorize the pattern, the players had to physically step on the correct tiles. If they chose correctly, the tiles would flash green, allowing them to proceed. However, stepping on an incorrect tile would cause the entire grid to flash red, resulting in elimination. Gridlock follows a similar premise, challenging players to memorize and recall tile patterns under pressure.
